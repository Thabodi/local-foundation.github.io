We have been running *founder.chat* since the beginning of the year in
Nelson and I wanted to recap briefly on what I see emerging as a
pattern. We have summer, it is beautiful weather every Thursday and
still, we have between 15 and 30 people at Bridge Street every Thursday.
We work on small or big problems, but every week we work on someones
issues in a few groups. We have a few regulars and a good amount of
"first timers" every time so that the community grows, the feedback
people get to their current road blocks changes and the experience in
the group starts to rise. 

The group has good amount of diversity in terms of skills, gender,
cultural heritage and age which makes it super exciting to work through
road blocks. We also have a few facilitators that either already ran
founder.chat or put their hand up to run it in the future to make sure
we have a broad base of people involved that can keep the weekly
schedule.

The social part of the meetup at Freehouse is getting the group more and
more together so that experience is getting passed on and new
friendships are made. From the first two months of founder.chat I can
happily report a full "mission accomplished" and will report back once
we have a longer time frame to look back on.

If you are interested in running a founder.chat in your town, please get
in touch, we are happy to help you get it going.
