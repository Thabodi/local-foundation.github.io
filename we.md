*local.foundation* is a community driven initiative that collects and
shares things we see work in our communities to increase the level of
entrepreneurship. Resilient communities have a high degree of local
businesses that are supported by the local community. To create this
fabric we need to engage the community in businesses and make them
part of the process of developing new ones.

that can be cherry-picked from.
